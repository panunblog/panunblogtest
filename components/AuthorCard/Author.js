            Ahmed Pathan: Hey everyone! I am a 17 year old living in Kashmir who
            is studying in 11th grade. I am currently running a research society
            for high schoolers in my community, and I am also co-authoring a
            paper on AI and finance this autumn. I am absolutely in love with
            creative writing, debating and art. Feel free to drop a message on
            Instagram at <a href="instagram.com/stfu.ahmed" className="links_author_socials">@stfu.ahmed</a>.

            Srinagar, and I love physics. I also enjoy reading, playing
            football, and arithmetic. Since I was a young boy, Einstein has held
            a special place in my heart, which led me to develop a fascination
            with relativity theory. I'll do my best to give you helpful and
            meaningful stuff, so keep an eye out for my blogs.
