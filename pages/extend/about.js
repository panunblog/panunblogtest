          The Panun Blog is a multimedia platform aimed at providing an
          inclusive forum for the people of Kashmir valley and beyond. Our
          vision is to facilitate a channel of healthy discourse and debate
          within the Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri communities. The idealistic
          tendency of humans to view the world as good or evil is a
          misinterpretation of reality. The outcomes of dialogue or the lessons
          to be learnt from our history cannot be distinctively categorized as
          being black or white. Look closely and youâ€™ll see a broad patchwork of
          different shades of grey. We at the Panun Blog, do not claim that one
          will find an objective truth in this greyish spectrum, but atleast
          negotiations within this realm is where we will find commonalities
          with our adversaries and strive passionately to gather the courage to
          put aside futile differences and coexist peacefully for the sake of
          our future generations. Do you ever feel like you have something to
          say to the world but don't know where to start? Don't worry, we got
          you covered! Panun is open for accepting blogs and short posts on all
          sorts of topics. There is no need to be overly anxious about whether
          your blogs and posts are appropriate to be posted on our website.
          Anything that is sincerely coming from your heart is immensely
          precious to our entire community. You may never know what words of
          yours could awaken a people of internet users. So, what are you
          waiting for? Post that piece of poetry on our website which is buried
          in your phone for too long now. Talk about your life and your ways of
          surviving in this brutal world: you too are a source of inspiration
          for someone on this globe. Aspire to inspire! We seek to strive hard
          in order to put out the different shades of truth in the virtual
          domain, while fostering an atmosphere where the voices of the most
          disadvantaged and repressed sections of the society are amplified so
          that their words and views are given a fair hearing that they
          rightfully deserve. Here you will discover the unsung, blooming
          intellectuals of our time, who by the sheer power of their pen
          illuminate the dark corners of our world. Let the streets of the world
          echo the voices of the voiceless! Panun's founder has been working on
          his dream project of creating the ultimate #panunplatform for months
          now. We have partnered with various local, national and international
          stakeholders to ensure a multifaceted collaboration of talented and
          ambitious thinkers and writers from all around the world via this
          platform. A lot of pain and efforts have been utilised in its making,
          but most importantly our love and passion for Kashmir and its people
          has driven us to launch this platform keeping in mind the need for
          spreading the positivity and the energy of Keashur Kalam on the
          internet. It is the way of our founder to say thanks to what Kashmir
          has blessed him with, and do something worthwhile for his people. The
          word Panun finds its roots in the Kashmiri jargon, meaning 'one's
          own'. The entire Panun Team hopes that this platform feels no less
          than a home, both to the readers as well as to the authors. As the
          name suggests, consider this blog 'to be your own.' We welcome
          teenagers and adults alike to contribute their works on our platform.
          Join the movement today! We are constantly improving our channels of
          communication through which we can effectively connect with our
          audience. Provide your valuable feedback by writing to us at
